In this Project I Just Download the Dataset from Worldometer.com as .xlsx and Load this Dataset Into SSMS.
Then I use SQL Queries for exploring the Dataset and Extracted some Tables for Analysis report.
I load those tables into Tableau Public and create some visualizations as Shown in 'Tableau Dashboard'.
